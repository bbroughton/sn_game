<!-- Fact Slider -->
<p class = "info" display = "none"> The SN provides communications and navigation services for a variety of missions/users, including launch vehicles, satellites/satellite busses, payloads, and researchers on Earth (e.g., South Pole locations). </p>
<p class = "info" display = "none">The SN is currently composed of a fleet of relay satellites, known as the Space Segment, and associated ground systems, known as the Ground Segment.  The SN Space Segmentâ€™s fleet includes the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), located in geosynchronous orbit, and serves as a data relay system between the SN ground systems and the user platforms.</p>
<p class = "info" display = "none">The tandem RF/optical signal path from an SN Ground Segment terminal through a relay satellite and on to a customer/user platform is referred to as a forward link.  The tandem RF/optical signal path from a customer/user platform to the relay satellite and back to a ground terminal is referred to as a return link.</p>
<p class = "info" display = "none">The portion of a forward or return link that connects a ground terminal with the relay satellite is referred to as a Space-to-Ground Link (SGL); the portion of a forward or return link that connects the relay satellite with a customer/user platform is referred to as a Space-to-Space Link (SSL)</p>
<p class = "info" display = "none"> The ground segment of the SN includes three ground stations in Guam, White Sands, and  Blossom Point.</p>
